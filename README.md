Front- and back-end for tools using Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), Applicative Universal Grammar (AUG), and Radical Construction Grammar (RCG).

It's work in progress. It can parse a little English NSM already.

The research question here is this: can language processing avoid linguistic bias in morphosyntactic variation? My tentative answer is yes. NSM abstract syntax may make it possible to devise a language-independent representation for representing language processing, by making NSM itself the basis for algorithmic specification. Describing languages could be mediated by any chosen language that gets added to the database. The question arises, however: couldn't that specification resemble only one language, and thus be thought biased toward that language? This question inspired a thought experiment.

*The Legend of L0*

Once upon a time, during a period of climate change, a tribe migrating in search of better land and better neighbors camped for the night, at the base of a mountain, only to discover in the morning that one of their little girls was missing.

They traced her footprints up a mountain slope, up into snow. At the top of a ridge, they found themselves looking down into a very deep caldera, lushly forested. They also found themselves looking down a very steep, icy slope. The little girl was at the snow line. "I can't climb back up!", she cried. "It's too icy!"

So the whole clan gathered at the top of the slope, and one by one, they all slid down. Then they descended further into a veritable Land of Milk and Honey. What they didn't know, however, is that they were also descending into a pit of zoonotic viruses.

The animals were easy game. Some seemed almost blind, deaf, or both, and clumsy. Unfortunately, eating this meet began to infect the tribe.

The first infection paralyzed their vocal cords. They hastily devised a sign language, and a crude clay-tablet cuneiform system. But something was lacking: communication in real time, over distances. So they also devised a very stripped-down whistle language.

The next infection unfortunately robbed them of eyesight. They were very skilled at making traps, however, and knew the lay of the land well enough to harvest berries, fruit, and roots.

The next infection rendered them deaf. They laboriously renewed communication by inventing symbols they could draw in each other's hands in a special code based on the whistle language.

Then they got infected with a virus that left them very clumsy, with little manual dexterity. But they managed to renew communication again with a code consisting of two symbols--a tighter grip, then a looser one.

All of this meant they had to cooperate much more. And because of this need for cooperation, they decided: lying would be punished severely, and if a member proved incorrigible, having been robbed of hearing, eyesight, and fine movement, simply shunning the member would guarantee death by starvation. Under these constraints of speed of communication and difficulty of group survival without perfect cooperations, Grice's Maxims became their overriding "cultural script." 

The climate began to change again, however, and their previously-rich ecosystem fell under strain. Hunger became a problem. Finally, one day, someone decided to try escaping the former Land of Milk and Honey. She climbed up the original slope and was surprised that her hands never hit snow and ice as she crawled. She reached the lip of the giant caldera, and carefully moved down the gentler slope, leaving trail signs she could feel so that she could retrace her path. She finally reached vegetation.

When she made her way back home, she informed everyone: it could be better outside. Let's try. They moved up and out. In the outside world, other people took pity on them. What they didn't know, however, is that the new arrivals carried disabling diseases, and not long after, almost all of humanity, except the original clan and a few adopted members, died of starvation, unable to adapt to all of the infections at once. Over many generations, however, people evolved resistance to the diseases, until the zoonotic viruses were little worse than passenger viruses, language revived in whistle form and sign language form, and finally humanity regained the use of its vocal cords.

Language variation appeared quickly, and pretty soon everyone was speaking dialects of L0, some of them even mutually unintelligible and all of them somewhat more flowery. L0 regained a spoken variety, and was very useful in translating and teaching the burgeoning languages that increasingly varied.

Unfortunately, people also started lying again. But you can't have everything.

THE END

Even if we imagine that L0 had a binary system of symbols, with no inflection or agglutination, with parts of speech determined only by word order, this still leaves a number of degrees of freedom, such as whether the sentence pattern would be SOV, SVO, OVS; and the exact binary coding of words. What I think suffices for this thought experiment is that L0 is not any particular language, but isn't any less expressive than any other language, because of the power of NSM primes and reductive paraphrase. The very fact (?) that nothing like it has ever existed, but also that, under the Legend scenario above, it probably _could_ exist (whether in the distant past, the far future, or even in some unexplored area of the world  today), is enough to establish that a binary representation of NSM isn't inherently biased toward any particular language.
